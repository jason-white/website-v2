<h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Thanks for stopping by. There isn't much to see at the moment, but check back periodically.</p>
<p>So far I've...</p>
<ul>
<li>Moved my Hugo site back to Netlify</li>
<li>Added the banner linking here</li>
<li>Created a new 11ty project and GitHub repo (the page you're on now)</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal here is to design and build this site in the open using only ideas, sketches and the browser. No Figma, Penpot etc.</p>
<p>-- Jason</p>
