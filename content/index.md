# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. There isn't much to see at the moment, but check back periodically.

So far I've...

- Moved my Hugo site back to Netlify
- Added the banner linking here
- Created a new 11ty project and GitHub repo (the page you're on now)

My goal here is to design and build this site in the open using only ideas, sketches and the browser. No Figma, Penpot etc.
