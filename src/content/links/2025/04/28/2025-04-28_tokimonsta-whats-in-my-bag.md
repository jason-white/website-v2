I haven't listened to TOKiMONSTA in a while. I really like her music. She's a beat producer, or at least started out as one. {% externalLink "https://album.link/s/7xDQlillR9FwIIoxgKSEQb", "Her new album" %} is more house and disco, and so far, I am really digging it.

Her picks on this episode of What's In My Bag were all super good, but what I'm mostly interested in is this set of books by {% externalLink "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Nagai", "Hiroshi Nagai." %} His illustrations look like vectors, but they're all hand painted. He apparently did a lot of {% externalLink "https://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/japanese-city-pop-ultimate-guide", "Japanese City Pop" %} album covers.
