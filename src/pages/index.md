# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. There isn't much to see at the moment, but check back periodically.

So far I've...

- Moved my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site back to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
- Added the banner linking here
- Created a new [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) project and GitHub repo (the page you're on now)
- Added the Spotify Netlify function back.
- Reconfigured the folder structure
- Added CUBE CSS and Utopia
- Added a [music collection](/music-collection)

My goal here is to design and build this site in the open using only ideas, sketches and the browser. No Figma, Penpot etc.
